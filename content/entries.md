## 2023-12-20
I was staring at my monitor today, and I wanted to open youtube to watch a video and I didn't want to type on my keyboard. So, I wondered, if I can do something about this. I thought about it and wondered *"what if i could develop a system where I can just type by looking at my screen?"*. After putting some thought into it, I thought I could use [morse code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code), that way I can just type by blinking. Maybe I can write something up to do this. Idk, maybe there is a better way to do it, we'll see.
