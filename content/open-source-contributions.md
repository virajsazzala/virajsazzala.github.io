Being a computer science enthusiast, I often wondered about the inner workings of the closed-off software programs that we use daily. That curiosity eventually led me to the realm of open source and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). While using open source software, I developed a desire to contribute and make these projects better, but initially, I had no idea where to start. To simplify this journey, I've created a comprehensive guide to open source software, aimed at helping those who want to dive into this exciting world.

## What is Open Source?

Open source software has source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Projects often accept contributions from the public, creating a community around the software.

## How to Start

> **Note**: Learn Git and GitHub basics, including forking, branches, pull requests, etc.

### Finding a Project

- Look at software you already use and check if it is open source 
- Explore sites like GitHub Explore, GitLab Explore, SourceForge, etc
- Search for topics that interest you
- Filter by popularity, recency, language, etc

### Analyzing a New Project

- Read through the `README` carefully
- Read `CONTRIBUTING` guidelines if available
- Review the open issues and discussions
- Study the codebase structure

### Making Your First Contribution

- Start with smaller/easier issues, look for the `good first issues` label or similar
- Create a fork, make a new branch for the issue and make changes in your copy 
- Open a pull request against the main repository
- Respond to code review feedback

### Next Steps

- Find ways to continuously contribute
- Participate in discussions 
- Join the community on forums, chat groups
- Consider major contributions or leadership roles  

> **Note**: If you're feeling overwhelmed choosing a project, just pick a beginner-friendly repository to get started.

## Conclusion

The open source community appreciates new contributors. Start small, be helpful, and have fun!
