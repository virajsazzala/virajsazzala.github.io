Today, I decided to write to work a bit on the world. So, I divided my world into sections, and each section has it's own entities, and when the player enters a section, the camera move and shows that individual section. It feels much better than making the camera follow the player. Now, I'll add entities to the section, so time to make more sprites ig. Also, for now, I named the game "Trapped".

I wrote some basic scripts, like one that generates mazes given a maze blueprint as a file input, a simple platformer game, etc.. But, I've been getting a bit bored, and I always had this idea to make my own game, something like [Faith: The unholy trinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith:_The_Unholy_Trinity). I love the 8-bit style graphics and the eerie vibe. So, I decided to write my own. I setup the basic project structure, setup window, made the player sprite and loaded him into the game. Also, I added the letter feature, where the player can interact with a letter entity and it'll display some text on scree, its for telling the story, kinda. I still have to polish this part a lot and since I'm writing from scratch with no game engine and I'm new to C++ and SFML, it's taking some time to get through stuff.

I been learning to use SFML, but here is a problem I found. The way people usually setup game dev projects, is using Visual Studio on windows. I move a lot between OSes cause I use two different devices, one with windows and one with linux. Also, I don't like the way Visual studio works or the way projects are setup and structured on it. So, I decided to write a template for structuring cpp projects and I did it. Now, I can easily move b/w OSes and work the way I'm used to working.

I wanted to learn C++ properly and get good at it. So, I decided to work on some projects. But, I was confused about what kind of projects I wanna work on and finally, I decided to write games. I looked into it, and started looking into [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). Also, since I never did anything related to Graphics much, It seemed kinda daunting. But, I kinda got the hang of it, after following some tutorials and docs.
