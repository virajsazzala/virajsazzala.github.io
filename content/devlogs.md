I've started leetcoding a bit again, and it's been quite sometime. I've noticed that most problems are getting much more easier to understand and solve, might actually keep up the pace and make it a habit. I've also been studying deep learning a bit, found some good resources.

Today, I decided to write to work a bit on the world (I'm making a small game). So, I divided my world into sections, and each section has it's own entities, and when the player enters a section, the camera move and shows that individual section. It feels much better than making the camera follow the player. Now, I'll add entities to the section, so time to make more sprites ig. Also, for now, I named the game "Trapped".

I been learning to use SFML, but here is a problem I found. The way people usually setup game dev projects, is using Visual Studio on windows. I move a lot between OSes cause I use two different devices, one with windows and one with linux. Also, I don't like the way Visual studio works or the way projects are setup and structured on it. So, I decided to write a template for structuring cpp projects and I did it. Now, I can easily move b/w OSes and work the way I'm used to working.

I've decided to make a page to throw random thoughts whenever I feel like it. Some updates on what I'm working on, new things I've explored, etc..
