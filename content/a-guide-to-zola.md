Many people have reservations about using Static Site Generators and prefer building their websites manually. I used to share this perspective, but I've come to realize that it's not always the best choice. Often, individuals tend to complicate things by using complex technologies like React and intricate backend systems, which can lead to unnecessary complexity. Here's why.

# Why Use Zola Over Building Your Own Site

- **Saves time** - Zola provides a complete static site generator out of the box, saving you the effort of building all the core functionality from scratch. For example, here's how you can get started with Zola:

    ```bash
    cargo install zola
    zola init my_website
    cd my_website
    zola serve
    ```

- **Focus on content** - With Zola, you can direct your energy towards creating content instead of developing a generator. Zola handles tasks like converting Markdown to HTML, managing themes, and more. For instance, creating a new content page in Zola is as simple as writing a Markdown file:

    ```markdown
    +++    
    title = "My New Page"    
    date = 2023-10-15
    +++

    Your content goes here.
    ```

- **Built-in features** - Zola comes equipped with a variety of useful features such as native Markdown support, theme integration, Sass/SCSS processing, and more. Here's how you can include a theme in your Zola project:

    ```toml
    [extra]
    theme = "my-awesome-theme"
    ```

- **Performance** - Zola generates incredibly fast static sites, as all HTML pages are prebuilt. No server-side processing is necessary. 

- **Security** - Static sites, like those generated by Zola, are inherently more secure since there is no server-side code to exploit.

- **Easier deployment** - Deploying Zola sites is a breeze with popular services like GitHub Pages and Netlify. Here's how you can deploy your Zola site to GitHub Pages:

    ```bash
    zola build
    git checkout --orphan gh-pages
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial GitHub Pages commit"
    git push origin gh-pages
    ```

- **Customizable** - Extend Zola's functionality by using plugins or the Rust API. You can even add your own logic to meet unique requirements. Here's an example of creating a custom Zola plugin:

    ```rust
    // zola-plugin.rs
    extern crate zola;

    fn my_custom_plugin(context: &mut zola::Context) {
        // Your custom logic here
    }

    zola::register_plugin!("my_custom_plugin", my_custom_plugin);
    ```

- **Open source** - Zola is open-source software with a thriving community. You can contribute to its development, share your insights, and collaborate with like-minded developers.

For most use cases, using an existing mature generator like Zola will be faster and more productive than building your own. But you can still customize and extend it!
