<!-- more -->

Today, It was interesting to say the least. I had the day off today, as I didn't have an exam. I woke up, and I wanted to finish the scheduling thing, that I wanted to do i.e, making a list of assignments and stuff that I had to submit. Then, I got off bed, ate some breakfast (more like lunch).

After that, I wanted to search some stuff about the suggestions GPT gave yesterday regarding physics and machine learning. So, I started looking into Dectection of Gravitational Waves from Black hole mergers. It was honestly as fascinating topic. I did a bit of internet searching and I learnt what they are and how are they being detected and so on. It was pretty interesting, I did have some questions and actually a few ideas where these Gravitational waves that are being detected can be used to find some other stuff, but I don't exactly know if this already exists, but I'll do some more searches, and find out.

After this, I was looking into exoplanets and was trying to being a model to predict some properties of exoplanets. It learnt some interesting stuff. But, I didn't finish the project, I have some other ideas, I'll say more about that, when I go through with them.

After that, I just spend some time playing Horizon Zero Dawn, actually spent quite some time playing it.

So, thats's all for now. Night night!
