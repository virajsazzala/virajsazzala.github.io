## Hello..

I'm Viraj, a 20yr old who's into disassembling computers, and writing software. This is my little corner on the Internet, where I post about things I find fascinating.

> *a place where I can dump the chaos in my head*

Take a stroll and maybe you'll find something nice.

### Some things about me
- I stay up most nights.
- I'm obsessed with computers.
- I like to keep things simple.
- I agree with the [hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude) ideology.
- I mostly prefer planning over "going with the flow".
