  My experience with GNU&#x2F;Linux
</h1>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-02-06</strong></p>

<p>My experience with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">GNU/Linux</a> has been weird ride, I have been using these systems for approximately a year and a half. I fell in love with them, since the day I heard about them. When I first downloaded <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and started using it, I could feel that It is just different and I like different. The power of the terminal was just perfect. I loved it. I started looking more into it, and as I kept diving deeper, I realised there is much more to it. </p>
<p>Soon, I discovered the reddit page <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">/r/unixporn</a>, and it blew my mind. I thought to myself, is this really possible, to customize your desktop to that level. So, I started learning about ricing. I had to discover all of this by myself, so it took some time, but I was never afraid to break my computer, so I just went for it. Honestly, It was the best choice, because I learnt a lot. I moved to <a href="https://archlinux.org/">ArchLinux</a> and tried many other distros but only some of them were my fit.</p>
<p>But, not everything is fun, I even saw the sophisticated, elitist, and toxic side of this community and slowly hated it. It started to change me, but after a while, I understood and chose my own path. </p>
<p>Now, I follow my own path. All my computers use Linux. I use the distribution - <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">PopOS by System76</a>. I use this distribution, because It has everything I need. I don't want to dive deeper into this right now, but try it for yourself and you'll know. </p>
<p>I'm getting better with shell scripting, and I'm planning to do a mini project with shell soon, keep tabs on the projects section for updates. </p>
