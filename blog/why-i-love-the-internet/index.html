  Why I love the internet?
</h1>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-02-06</strong></p>

<p>I love technology, I really really do. Everything about it just fascinates me! It's so cool. But, why? really good question, I'll tell you all about it. Well, In society, everyone that loves technology or computers are labeled as nerds or geeks. If you are one and are labelled as a geek or something, don't worry, just remember, that is something people do to make them feel themselves feel superior. So, next time someone calls you a geek or something, be happy that they see you as someone way more smarter than them. so, now that basic therapy is done, let's get into why I love tech.</p>
<p>Well, It makes me feel good. Like, In case of the Internet, I feel at home when I'm on it. When I browse through reddit pages or any articles, and I read about people sharing their experience about a certain topic, I feel less alone. I have a beautiful thought it my head, which is &quot;ah, guess I'm not the only one!&quot;. That's an awesome feeling, ngl.</p>
<p>I spoke to a lot of people on the internet, from different parts of the world. They shared their perspectives and I shared mine. It felt good. This is the reason why most of us love the internet, It connects us with people who understand us. But, still at the end of the day, when you go offline, you are all alone, but when you are online, you feel like you are living in a dream, a dream that you wanna stay in forever.</p>
<p>It's a place of endless possibilites. Technology is just awesome. You can do so much stuff, you could build anything you imagine, you can bring your fantasies to reality. When I was a kid, I remember watching all these movies and be like, &quot;woah, so a person can build such cool stuff? can I do that? one day, even I want my own robot and me and my robot will unravel the mysteries of the universe and it'll be awesome&quot;. I was so obssessed with space, stars, etc.</p>
<p>Later, When I started using computers, I just got obssessed. When I made my first chat bot, which was basically just a lot of print and if statements, it felt so cool. When I first saw the cmd in windows, I remember screaming &quot;I'm a hacker now!&quot; Eventhough now, I can actually use the terminal properly, I still feel the same level of excitement. It's just awesome.I will never stop learning about tech and experiencing it. It's so beautiful and awesome. I will learn as much as possible and I believe that everyone should learn at least a bit about it. </p>
