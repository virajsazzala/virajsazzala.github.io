  Getting started with Web Development
</h1>

<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-02-06</strong></p>

<p>Recently, I started getting into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">web development</a>. I've actually been interested in it for quite a while now, but never really got into it. I made some basic websites and played around with it, but never actually dove deep into it. Now, that I'm in my 4th semester of college, and I'm done with all the basics of other subjects. It's time for me to get into actual software engineering related topics. So, I decided that I'll start of with web development.</p>
<p>I find it fascinating, to be able to build websites that can be accessed by billions of people around the world and to be able to share your thoughts and ideas with all of them in a well structured manner. It almost seems like magic. The better one is at developing websites, the better one can express themselves online. I see websites as a means of escape, an escape from the constraints social media and the world puts on a person. A website, is your personal space, you can post anything you want and share your ideas, no one is stopping you from sharing your ideas and thoughts and well expressed thoughts are always appreciated by someone or the other. </p>
<p>As of now, I am good with the basics - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JS</a>. I started learning frameworks and libraries such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, etc.. I found Backend development really interesting and will be studying it for some time. Currently getting better with Express. I hope to soon host this website on my own VPS and actually develop it much more. </p>
<p>But, since I have some other project ideas in mind too, It might take a while. If you wonder what projects I'm currently working on, take a look at the projects section</p>
