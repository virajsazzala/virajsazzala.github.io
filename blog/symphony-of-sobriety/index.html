It’s like we’re in a trance, believing whatever the majority says and ignoring anyone who’s different. We’re obsessed with success, power, and money, thinking that’s what life’s about. We listen to the rich, do what they say, and sometimes even hurt others just to be like them. But deep down, we’re lost, not sure why we’re here or what we’re supposed to do.<p>Someone once said life is just one long struggle, and it’s up to us to pick how we want to suffer. So why do so many people choose the hardest path, living in misery instead of finding a way out? Somehow, many of us end up in a kind of self-made hell, stuck in suffering that we’ve chosen. It’s like we’re trapped in a dark place, thinking this is just how life is meant to be. It’s like plunging into the depths of hell, isn’t it? We find ourselves in this grim landscape of suffering, we’re shackled by our own choices, bound by chains of self-doubt and fear But why? Why pick the worst kind of pain and stick with it? There’s this weird idea that if you try to break free from the misery, you’re weak or cowardly. But maybe it’s the other way around. Maybe it takes real strength to say, “I’m done with this,” and try to find a way out. It’s like following the crowd right into the flames, thinking it’s the right thing to do, when maybe the real truth lies in escaping those flames altogether. Just because everyone thinks something’s right doesn’t mean it actually is. Sometimes, the truth is found in the quiet voices of those who don’t fit in.<p class=tagsData><a href=/tags/philosophy>/philosophy/</a></main><footer><hr><div class=footContainer><div class=footLeft><p>SNG Viraj Reddy © 2025</div></div></footer></div>
